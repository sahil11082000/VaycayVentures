# Vaycay Ventures

<p>
Vaycay Ventures is a Platform which uses travel related data from world bank organization in tourism sector, and with the help machine learning model it will try to Predict the expenditure of the passenger for related tour of a particular place. Vaycay Ventures is design to analyze the data present at world bank and help user to create an estimated budget for their travel. It help in reducing the time to calculate the travel budget manually.

Problem Statement:
In a survey taken by World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international tourist arrivals reached 1.5 billion in 2019, 
which equates to an average of over 4 million people traveling internationally each day.This number has likely been 
significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions put in place by many countries

According to a 2020 survey by Solo Traveler, approximately 72% of all travelers have taken a solo trip at some point 
in their lives. The same survey found that among those who identified as solo travelers, 33% take solo trips exclusively, 
while the remaining 67% take both solo trips and trips with others.

But to plan a trip, whether it's a solo trip or with others. One always have to plan the budget of the trip, where things 
get really messy. One of the most common problems that travelers encounter in planning the budget of a trip is 
underestimating the total cost of travel. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as not accounting for all the expenses 
associated with transportation, lodging, food, activities, and incidentals.

Other challenges that travelers face when planning their travel budget include:

1. Lack of knowledge about local costs:
Travelers may not be familiar with the cost of living in the destination they are traveling to, 
which can make it difficult to accurately estimate the cost of travel expenses.

2. Unexpected expenses:
Travelers may encounter unexpected expenses, such as medical emergencies, lost or stolen luggage, or 
additional fees for activities or transportation, which can quickly add up and impact their budget.

3. Currency exchange rates:
Travelers may not be familiar with currency exchange rates, which can impact the cost of lodging, food, and other expenses.

4. Seasonal price fluctuations:
The cost of travel can vary widely depending on the time of year, with peak travel season typically being more expensive than off-season travel.

All these factors affect the budget and time to estimate the budget for the trip. 
To Solve this problem we have created a solution "Vaycay Ventures", which is a machine learning application used 
to predict the estimated budget for a travel from one place to another. Vaycay Ventures not only predict the budget 
for travellers but also helps in finding which place to visit by showing a Dashboard displaying information about 
most visited places in world, and lots of other things which helps traveller to better their travelling experience. 
This application would help travellers to reduce the timing of making budget for trip 
from hours of research and study into seconds with the help of our machine learning model.

Problems Encountered and Solutions:

1. Finding the top tourist place (geolocation)  -> (GOOGLE MAP API)
2. Finding the hotels/rooms/hostel rooms(geolocation) -> (GOOGLE MAP API)
3. Finding places to cafes/ restaurants/ dhabaa (geolocation) -> (GOOGLE MAP API)
4. Finding local transport stations of city (geolocation) -> (GOOGLE MAP API)
5. finding routes from "staying place" to "tourist places" -> (All Pair Shortest Path)
6. Travelling cost from one city to another(round trip) -> Train / flight / Bus
7. Dashboard for top tourist place -> Finding the most visited places in a city
